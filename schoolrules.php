            <h4>Hogwarts Grounds</h4>
            <p>*Students shall not leave Hogwarts grounds.
*Students may leave with the Headmaster's permission, if collected by a parent or guardian.
*On the first and third weekends of each month, Third through Seventh Years may visit Hogsmeade Village with a permission slip from the student's parent or guardian. Students are free to travel to Hogsmeade after classes on Friday (3:00 pm) until curfew (10:00 pm), when they are expected to be back in their dorms at Hogwarts. On Saturday and Sunday they may from after breakfast (8:00 am) until curfew (10:00 pm) on the same day.
*Visitors to Hogwarts must obtain permission from the Headmaster or Deputy Headmaster. This includes parents of students, and Ministry personnel.
*The only exceptions to this rule are members of the Hogwarts Board of Governors, who have free access to the school.
            </p>
            <h4>House Areas</h4>
            <p>*Access to common rooms and dormitories is strictly controlled.
*Students may not enter the common rooms or dormitories of houses other than their own. Each common room has a protective measure in place to restrict access. The Gryffindor Tower and Slytherin Dungeon require passwords. Ravenclaw Tower requires the answer to a riddle. The Hufflepuff Basement requires tapping a specific barrel in a particular rhythm. Attempts to bypass these protective measures by members of other houses are considered serious offences.
*Boys may not enter the girls' dormitories. Attempts to do so will trigger spells preventing it, such as a Slide Spell on the staircases in the Gryffindor and Ravenclaw rooms. The one exception to this is a male Prefect in an emergency.</p>        
            <h4>Curfew</h4>
            <p>*Students must be in their dormitories and in bed by a 10:00 p.m. curfew.
Students may not leave their house common rooms until 6:00 a.m.
Prefects may be out of bed after hours if they are scheduled for patrol duty. Prefects must still remain within the castle during patrols.</p>
